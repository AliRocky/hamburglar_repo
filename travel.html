			<a href="https://www.gohawaii.com"/> Honolulu, Hawaii</a>
			<h3>Why do I want to visit Hawaii?  Well.. Why Not?!! Its only a few hours away via direct American American flight and you don't even need a passport!  If you're an American Citizen or Permanent Resident all you have to do is book your flight and hotel! While there on one of the many islands there are several things that you can do to be involved with the local customs.</h3>
